<h1>The Code Breakers game!</h1>
Welcome to "The Code Breakers Game", a Python-powered application that tests your logical thinking and problem solving skills! As a player you'll have to decipher a secret code, within a limited number of attempts, using logic, deduction and feedback given each time to uncover the correct sequence of numbers. With three different difficulty modes, this game is perfect for beginners and experienced coders alike!

<h2>Relevant User stories</h2>
<p>The foundation of this Web application is built on the following user stories:</p>
<ol>
<li id="US1">As a player, I want to start the game via a simple menu, so that I can begin immediately without confusion about game options.</li>
<li id="US2">As a player, I want to receive clear feedback about how many elements are correct and in the right position, and how many are correct but in the wrong position, so that I can use logical deduction for my next attempts.
</li>
<li id="US3">As a player, I want to know how many attempts I have remaining, so that I can plan my strategy within the gameâ€™s constraints.</li>
<li id="US4">As an experienced player, I want to be able to adjust the code length and difficulty level, so that the game becomes more challenging and I can improve my skills.

<h3>Fixed bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>The program was originating two different secret codes and was prompting the user to input their guess twice. This was caused by the the generate_secret_code(mode) and input_guessed_code(gen_code, digits, attempts) being called twice. Since both functions return a tuple with three variables, I had to unpack them in order to access the variables that I had to pass as arguments to the input_guessed_code function.
At the beginning I used the following solution:</li>

<img src="assets/images-for-README/wrong-approach-to-input-guessed-code.PNG">

but then I understood that I was in fact calling the functions twice.
This was solved by:
1. merging the function that was handling the input of the user's guess and that, which was responsible for the validation of the entered code. The new function became check_guessed_code_against_secret_one(gen_code, digits, attempts)

generated_code = generate_secret_code(selected_mode)
user_input = input_guessed_code<strong style = "color: red">(*generated_code)</strong>

This solution prevents the input_guessed_code from being called twice

<li>At some point the program was seemingly swapping number_of_attempts with number_of_digits. This was caused by the order, in which I had mentioned the parameters inside the brackets of the check_guessed_code_against_secret_one(gen_code, attempts, digits) function, so when unpacking the tuple with the returned variables from the generated_code variable, the number_of_attempts and number_of_digits were being assigned respectively to digits and to attempts. This was simply fixed by changing the order of the parameters to (gen_code, digits, attempts).</li>



<li>When implementing colorama to add colour to the feedback elements (O, X and -), the terminal was returning something like:</li>
<br>
<em>"here is your feedback: ['\x1b[32mO\x1b[0m', '\x1b[33mX\x1b[0m', '\x1b[33mX\x1b[0m', '\x1b[33mX\x1b[0m']"</em>
<br>
This was caused by the feedback being provided to the user in the form of a list of strings.
To fix this, I used the .join method like in the example here below, to turn the list into one single string, where the colours where rendered correctly. CREDIT: Microsoft Copilot
<br>
print(f"Here is your feedback: {' '.join(feedback)}\n")
</ul>
